                We've always known that there is much more to Butlers than
                merely chivalry and etiquette. But how could we know there’s

                Butlers are an often overlooked class of people, despite their
                essential roles in the lives of the wealthy. They keep
                everything running, are there when you need them, and then seem
                to fade into the background when you don't!
              </p>
              <p class="paragraphs ps-5">
                Little did you know that all butlers lead double lives: they're
                all a part of a secret society, trained to benefit the whole of
                humanity from the background and never raising a fuss.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraphs ps-5">
                Until now, they've been able to do their work quietly and avoid
                being on the radar, but that's all about to change. As the evil
                world continues to evolve, a more direct approach is required:
                and the <b> Butlers for Humanity</b> are prepared to meet it
                head-on in Web 3.
